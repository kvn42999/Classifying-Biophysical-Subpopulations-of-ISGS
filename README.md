# Classifying-Biophysical-Subpopulations-of-ISGS
Code used to perform ISG Subpopulation Analysis

Pancreatic β-cells regulate blood glucose homeostasis by secreting insulin, which is processed and stored within secretory organelles called insulin secretory granules (ISGs). As insulin matures from proinsulin, ISGs undergo extensive biochemical and structural remodeling, leading to a heterogenous mixture of subpopulations that vary in protein and lipid content, maturity, and release competence. Defects in ISG maturation and alterations in subpopulation composition are implicated in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, yet systematic methods for defining ISG subpopulations remain limited. To provide a new perspective on ISG heterogeneity, we employ soft x-ray tomography (SXT), which can quantitatively measure the biochemical density of ISGs within whole β-cells. Within these tomograms, we apply unsupervised clustering to classify subpopulations based on biophysical features of ISGs such as molecular density, size, and spatial positioning. 

Below, a cell imaged using SXT is shown on the left, with the nucleus, mitochondria, plasma membrane, and ISGs shown. To the right, the different classified subpopulations of ISGs are depicted.
